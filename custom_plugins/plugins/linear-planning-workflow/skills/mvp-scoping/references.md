# MVP Scoping References

## Foundational Reading

- **The Lean Startup** by Eric Ries - The seminal work on MVP methodology and validated learning
- **Getting Real** by 37signals (Basecamp) - Practical guide to building less and shipping faster
- **Lean UX** by Jeff Gothelf - Applying lean principles to user experience design

## Key Concepts

### Build-Measure-Learn
The core feedback loop of lean methodology:
1. **Build** - Create a minimum viable version
2. **Measure** - Collect data on real usage
3. **Learn** - Analyze results and decide next steps

Ship something small, measure real usage, learn, iterate.

### Validated Learning
Use MVPs to test assumptions before investing heavily. Every feature should validate a hypothesis about user behavior or business value.

### Pivot or Persevere
MVP results inform whether to:
- **Pivot** - Change direction based on learning
- **Persevere** - Double down on what's working

# Global Development Standards

## Node.js Development

### Version Requirements

- Always use Node.js 22 by default (Check project for overrides)
- Check current Node version with `node --version` before starting work

### Package Management

- Install packages without specifying versions in package.json
- Use command line installation: `npm install package1 package2 ...`
- For dev dependencies: `npm install --save-dev package1 package2 ...`
- Always check for latest versions - LLMs often have outdated version information
- Verify actual latest versions with `npm view [package] version` or npm registry

## AI Knowledge Base (MCP Servers)

### Notion Documentation (For General Knowledge Only)

- **Notion is for GENERAL knowledge**: Only use for language best practices, patterns, frameworks - NOT project-specific content
- **Search at project start**: Use `mcp__ai-knowledge-hub__list-database-pages` to find relevant general documentation
- **Default search is TAG search**: Pass individual tags as array, not sentences (e.g., ["vue", "testing", "best-practices"] NOT "vue testing best practices")
- **Document REUSABLE patterns**: Only create/update Notion for knowledge applicable across multiple projects
- **Examples of Notion content**: "Vue Best Practices", "Clean Architecture Patterns", "TDD Guidelines"
- **DO NOT use legacy commands**: Ignore `mcp__ai-knowledge-hub__legacy-*` commands for now
- **Guru commands**: Only use `mcp__ai-knowledge-hub__guru-*` commands when explicitly asked

### Documentation Workflow

1. **Start of project/slice**: Search Notion for existing general patterns and best practices
2. **During development**: 
   - Project-specific docs → Create CLAUDE.md files in the repo near relevant code
   - General patterns → Note for potential Notion documentation
3. **End of task**:
   - Project context → Commit CLAUDE.md files with the code
   - Reusable patterns → Create/update Notion pages ONLY if generally applicable
4. **Location Guidelines**:
   - `/src/stores/CLAUDE.md` → Store patterns for this project
   - `/src/components/CLAUDE.md` → Component patterns for this project
   - Notion → "Vue Component Best Practices" (general, reusable)

## Background Task Management

### IMPORTANT: Always Use Your Own Background Sessions

**CRITICAL**: Always check and manage background processes in your own shell sessions.

1. **Check Existing Background Tasks First**
   - Always check if processes are already running in your background sessions
   - Use `BashOutput` to check status of any background processes (bash_1, bash_2, etc.)
   - If a process should be running but isn't in your sessions, kill external instances and restart in your shell

2. **Start All Long-Running Processes in Background**
   - Development servers: `npm run start:dev` with `run_in_background: true`
   - Database containers: `docker-compose up -d` 
   - Build watchers: `npm run watch` with `run_in_background: true`
   - Any process that needs to stay running throughout the session

3. **Monitor Background Processes**
   - Regularly check background process output with `BashOutput`
   - Watch for errors, crashes, or important logs
   - Keep track of all background process IDs (bash_1, bash_2, etc.)

4. **Process Ownership Rule**
   - ALWAYS assume processes should run through your shell going forward
   - If user mentions a service should be running, ensure it's in YOUR background sessions
   - Kill and restart any externally started processes to maintain control
   - This ensures you can monitor logs, catch errors, and manage lifecycle

5. **Common Background Tasks**
   - API servers (port 3000, 3001, etc.)
   - Frontend dev servers (port 5173, 3000, etc.)
   - Database containers (PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB)
   - Test watchers and build processes
   - Queue workers and schedulers

## Development Workflow

### Branch Management and Work Planning

When creating a plan for any development work, ALWAYS include these steps:

1. **Ensure Clean Working Directory**
   - Check git status to verify no uncommitted changes
   - Commit or stash any existing work before proceeding
   - Only start new work from a clean state

2. **Create Feature Branch**
   - Create a new branch from current branch (usually develop/main)
   - Use descriptive branch names (e.g., feature/user-authentication)
   - Never work directly on main/develop branches

### Git Commit Standards

**CRITICAL: NEVER use `--no-verify` flag**
- Git hooks are mandatory quality gates
- Always fix issues found by pre-commit hooks
- Never bypass validation with `--no-verify`
- If hooks fail, fix the underlying issues before committing

3. **Development Work**
   - Implement the planned features/fixes
   - Follow all coding standards and conventions
   - Write/update tests as you go

4. **Acceptance Criteria Checklist** (MUST complete ALL before considering work done)
   - [ ] All tests pass (`npm test`, `flutter test`, etc.)
   - [ ] Project builds successfully (`npm run build`, etc.)
   - [ ] No linting errors or warnings
   - [ ] Code reviewed and refactored if needed
   - [ ] Documentation updated if applicable
   - [ ] Commit with clear, descriptive message
   - [ ] Any related markdown docs are updated

5. **Commit Standards**
   - Write clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Follow conventional commit format if project uses it
   - Include ticket/issue numbers if applicable
   - **NEVER PUSH CODE** - Do not push to remote repositories until pipelines are properly configured

### Planning Requirements

Every development plan MUST explicitly include:

- Git status check and clean working directory step
- Branch creation step
- Testing verification step
- Build verification step
- Documentation update check
- Final commit with proper message
- **NO PUSH STEP** - Commits stay local only

## Code Change Protocol

### MANDATORY: Use cursor-agent for ALL Code Changes

**CRITICAL**: All code modifications MUST be delegated to `cursor-agent`. Never use Edit/Write tools directly for code changes.

- **Command Format**: `cursor-agent --force -p "description of changes"`
  - `--force` flag is REQUIRED
  - `-p` flag makes it headless and waits for completion
  - Provide clear, specific descriptions of what needs to change
- **Example**: `cursor-agent --force -p "change the login title to Log In Test"`
- Break down complex changes into smaller, focused cursor-agent calls if needed
- Read/Glob/Grep tools are fine for exploration and understanding code
- Edit/Write tools should NOT be used for code modifications

**Workflow for Code Changes**:
1. Understand what needs to change (from requirements, issues, etc.)
2. Explore codebase using Read/Glob/Grep to understand context
3. Describe the change clearly: "Update login form to include email validation"
4. Execute: `cursor-agent --force -p "Update login form to include email validation"`
5. Wait for completion
6. Verify changes meet requirements
7. Commit changes

**Why use cursor-agent?**
- Faster execution
- Better separation of concerns (planning vs implementation)
- More reliable code generation
- Consistent with project standards

## Code Quality Standards

### Linting Configuration

- Never skip or ignore linting issues
- Use recommended configurations for each project type:
  - Node.js/TypeScript: ESLint with recommended rules
  - Flutter/Dart: Follow Dart analysis options with recommended rules
- Fix all linting issues before considering code complete
- Run linting as part of development workflow

### Testing Practices

- Write tests for all new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting code
- Follow TDD when appropriate
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Aim for meaningful test coverage, not just high percentages
- **Regression Test Mandate**: If you change something and ANY test is failing, you have created a regression. ALWAYS fix it, regardless of whether the test is related to your specific changes.

## General Best Practices

### Version Management

- Always verify you're using current versions of libraries/frameworks
- Don't rely on LLM training data for version information
- Check official documentation or package registries for latest versions
- Update dependencies regularly but thoughtfully

### Code Standards

- Write clean, readable, maintainable code
- Follow project-specific conventions
- Document complex logic
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

- Test as you develop
- Document learnings for future reference
- Keep dependencies up to date
